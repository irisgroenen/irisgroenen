                <h1>Ewart</h1>
                <p>Ewart was mentored by the elven ranger Delsaran Virsyna. In exchange for his training, he fought in the elven army against the undead.</p> 
                <p>His family owns a farm in Farmer's Cross, where he was born and raised. 
                    <br>One of his siblings, his sister Cyn, made her way to New Baronscrest and is currently employed as housekeeper of our mansion.

                <h1>Leonard</h1>
                <p>Leonard was found as a caged lion, captured by the Dark Seal pirates. Being abruptly taken from his home, the Felwallow-Bridgebank grassland where he lived peacefully in a cave while enjoying the lazy lion life, he now has a severe hate for these pirates and hopes to get revenge some day. For now, this shy Druid with Lion Shaman powers augmented by the Sun, sticks around his rescuers to hopefully encounter his captors once again. After that, who knows? Though he grows more and more fond of his new friends.

                <h1>Merle</h1>
                <p>As far as she knows Merle was born in Baronscrest in a family of basket weavers. Restless and curious, she left home early to fend for herself.
                </p>
                <p>A house fire left her severely scarred, something she usually hides with magic. It also led her to an increasing bunch of strange new friends, trouble, and ultimately her current job as private investigator. She's having the time of her life.</p>

                <h1>Val'hadil</h1>
                <p>Val'hadil is a half-elf born into an elven family. They sent him to a monestary to be raised and after decided he was too human to stay with them they had Virsyna drop him off at Coppermound.</p>
                <p>Almost died. Often (and complains a lot about it). Has an interesting relationship with his magic carpet. Owner of happy doggo Goldie. Teaches Cyn (Ewarts sister) how to <span class="lt">fight</span> defend herself, which is a useful skill to have in the city. Insanely perceptive and mobile. Suspicious of bats.
