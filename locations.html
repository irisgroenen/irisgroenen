                <h3>New Baron's Crest</h3>
                <p>The city is divided into 9 districts: southern residence, northern residence, south warehouse, north warehouse, gate, harbour, market, noble, governmental.</p>
                <article id="nbc-abandoned-house">
                    <h4>Abandoned house</h4>
                    <p>An old house, warded with magic, that burnt down 15 years ago when it was still the home of Maisa Silverfields. The well is used by the cult to drop down mail, and we recently learned there's a Beholder down there. Probably just collecting stamps, right?</p>

                    <p>Lair of the Celoralin family. A minor noble family with major wealth. Maybe they're not all bad people but the patron of the family is trying hard to hide that fact.</p>

                    <h4>The Compass Rose</h4>
                    <p>A dockside tavern in the Harbour District, owned by Laila Redogo. It's been Merle's regular hangout since the place opened up in New Baron's Crest (did it exist in old baron's crest btw?). Tanith, one of her Night Runner friends, works there and is the owner's girlfriend. Laila has pretty strong ties to the Blue Sails.</p>

                    <h4>The Foaming Tankard</h4>
                    <p>An inn where Otto Beauclerc resides. Merle broke into his ridiculously heavily trapped room and found a suspicious to-do-list in his desk.</p>

                <article id="nbc-lighthouse">
                    <h4>The Lighthouse</h4>
                    <p>Near the coast just outside the city, used by the navy to stash goods. It has a secret tunnel leading to the northern docks. The Crimson Butterfly kept Cooper imprisoned there for weeks, using Maus' identity to frame him for the Baron's murder. Using the opportunity while investigating, Merle tagged the highest point of the lighthouse</p>

                    <h4>Loreseeker Mansion</h4>
                    <p>A fancy mansion in the Market District. The previous owner, the sage Leriandel Loreseeker, was brutally murdered in his home. The current owners, us, solved his murder and thereby inherited his house and most everything in it. Cyne, Ewart's sister, keeps the house. She also takes care of Goldie and makes sure Dawra has enough to eat when she drops by.</p>

                    <h4>Market District Guardhouse</h4>
                    <p>The MDG is led by Cpt. Richardson. Since she employed us to solve Loreseeker's murder, enough is happening to give us reason to visit the MDG every day - be it to speak with the Captain or to deliver/interrogate prisoners.</p>

                    <h4>The Palace</h4>
                    <p>Where the Baron lives and works and the barony's administration is conducted. We've been allowed to map the beautiful glass-domed ballroom, its gallery, the roof and the gardens thoroughly, in our assignment to prevent the Baron's assassination. We're also regularly reporting to the Baron in his office.</p>

                    <p>A seedy tavern at the docks. Dawra has made her home and laboratory underneath the very flammable, wooden building.</p>

                    <p>The guildhouse of the Baron's old adventurer's guild. It's updated regularly with assignments. The guild master's husband has a very adorable faerie dragon.</p>

                    <h4>Warehouse 8</h4>
                    <p>The warehouse where Eduard Strongarm conducts his illicit cult business.</p>

        <section id="fort-port">
            <h2>Fort Port</h2>
            <p>A naval base carved out of giant territory. The fort is built into and on top of the steep cliff. The fort is usually led by an Admiral and their staff, but because one is absent and one is dead, Ross Bau is now acting Admiral, Vice Admiral and acting Rear Admiral. Everything points towards a high ranking officer in the navy as the one responsible for the plot to kill the Baron.</p>
            <p>We've spoken with quite a few of those officers except for the elusive Counter Admiral (and Reave-At-Night). As far as we can tell at least Aughra Broadbeam, the half orc (not-very) retired selkie who works at the central desk, and Bash Giantbane, Bau's aide, are on our side.</p>
            <p>We managed to convince Bash to help us with our investigation into the missing gun powder. He found a little more than he asked for when he was nearly killed by black ops for following a trail. We smuggled him out of Fort Port, back to NBC with us.</p>

                <h3>The Fancy Unicorn Inn</h3>
                <p>A very fancy inn that has the most beautifully crafted pastry. We met with an elven woman there looking for Delsaran Virsyna.</p>

                <h3>The Grinning Skull</h3>
                <p>The bar where selkies go to drink and unwind and where marines fear to thread. We spent two evenings there without dying, though the second time we were drugged and dragged off for interrogation. Fun times.</p>
