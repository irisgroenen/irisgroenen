                    <p>An old house, warded with magic, that burnt down 15 years ago when it was still the home of Maisa Silverfields. The well is used by the cult to drop down mail, and we recently learned there's a Beholder down there. Probably just collecting stamps, right?</p>

                    <p>Lair of the Celoralin family. A minor noble family with major wealth. Maybe they're not all bad people but the patron of the family is trying hard to hide that fact.</p>
