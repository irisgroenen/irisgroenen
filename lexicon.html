                    <h3>Cooper</h3>
                    <p>Colin Celoralin, wild mage, renegade son of the Celoralin family who wants nothing to do with his snobby relatives. Curious, restless, quick to laughter. He accidentally summoned a demon once, which is how he met Dawra's father. He accidentally summoned an air elemental during a fair which wounded several and killed two people - a memory that haunts him. And he summoned a swarm of spiders during the posh wedding of his second cousin, but that was quite on purpose.<br> 
                        As Graue Maus (or Maus for short) he is a member of the Night Runners and his tag is a  fat grey mouse with crosses for eyes.<br>
                        After a spectacular stunt which made it seem he wanted to kill the baron he disappeared. Eventually the group found him imprisoned in a secret room in the Lighthouse. After some time in a safehouse he was allowed to leave and Merle asked him to be their eyes and ears at the Celoralin family. He reluctantly agreed.<br>
                        He has a squirrel familiar named Nutty. To make Dawra's father not eat him, he agreed to owing the demon a favour. When interrogated about his family, his eyes turned in the back of his head and he spouted "13 Prime Dark" in a creepy voice.</p>

                    <h3>Crimson Butterfly</h3>
                    <p>Also known as Skimmer, and Wa'athiel. Posed as a fisherman. Infamous elven assassin. Prince of royal blood, son of the queen Calanthea, married into the Falpillion family. Convicted in absentia and exiled for murder ~125 years ago. Blood-eagled his uncle during a war to avenge the death(s) of family. Staged several attempts on the Baron's life, intended to frame Cooper for the murder, and got Merle sent to the Coppermound Mines to keep her safe. Claims he was blackmailed by an unknown from the navy into murdering the Baron before Frostcome and is now a target himself for failing. The blackmail pertained a (less well-liked) sister in the elven kingdom but he's pulled strings to keep her safe.<br>Merle still considers him a friend but is pissed he didn't bother to apologise to Cooper for framing him.</p>

                    <p>Merle and Val accidentally stumbled upon the Cult's shrine below an old Mulak monestary, and later again when they investigated Loreseeker's murder. The Cult of Mammon is a cult dedicated to the devil of greed and attracts scum of the earth as worshippers - people who will do everything to get wealthier. They refer to themselves as the Financial Advancement Society.</p>

Member of the Night runners, goes under the name of Dr. Faraway with her tag being her initials DF in white and blue.<br> Her dry sense of humour makes her a popular member of the crew. She has a habit to space out randomly during a conversation and start talking in abyssal, which is why she can't hold a job and often relies on her friends or her special abilities to acquire (money for) food. <br>She lives under the Pissing Pixie tavern and runs an achemist laboratory. Recently the group learnt Dauntless is her physical alter ego.</p>
