            <h2>City Guard</h2>
            <p>Each district has a guard house and is headed by a captain. There is at least one colonel we know at the Market District. There are also several sergeants.</p>

            <h2>The Cult of Mammon</h2>
            <p>The 'Financial Advancement Society' as they call themselves are greedy, evil, pathetic cultists who serve Mammon, the Devil Lord of Greed, in the hopes of becoming wealthy quickly.</p>
            <p>While we are mainly tasked with investigating the plot to murder the Baron, we are personally invested in seeing the cult crash and burn.</p>

                <h3>Cult Hierarchy in New Baronscrest</h3>
                <p>While the ultimate boss is Mammon, this is what we know now of the members of the cult in New Baronscrest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coin Master:<br>
                        Blightbury, a halfling, in charge of the 9 districts
                        <ul>
                            <li>Coin Taker Torlon Barclay:<br>
                            responsible for the wealthy area, comprised of the noble, governmental and northern residence districts.</li>
                            <li>Coin Taker Zark Brokentooth:<br>
                            responsible for the poor area, comprised of the gate, southern residence and  southern warehouse districts.

                                <li>Coin Keeper Célante Finelle: southern warehouse district</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Coin Taker (name unknown, possibly a halfling named Sion):<br>
                            responsible for the trade area, comprised of the northern warehouse, market and harbour districts.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Coin Keeper Ralf Hunter: market district</li>
                                <li>Coin Keeper Eduard Strong-arm: northern warehouse district. Currently in the market district jail.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Coin Seeker Carl Zaïd. Currently in the market district jail.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are about 20 coin seekers per district. We know the cult has infiltrated the guard. The Stregulanti family is possibly roped in by the cult, given how they put up a job at the advernturer's guild to map the area where Merle and Val found the Temple of Mammon.</p>
